# BTCTrader

``BTCTrader`` is a programmatic trading application that supports many cryptocurrency exchanges, including bitmex, binance, bithumb, bitstamp, and more.

It also can simulated trade testing, and provides some indicators, and it is also very simple to implement your trading stategy.

It can be traded on a bitmex and can retrieve and analyze multiple exchange data in real time.

This project is not supported.  

Now I have rewritten the trading engine with C++, which uses the c++ template, which is more efficient and more reasonable. It will be used for nodejs or python library.

The new project is [TradingCore](https://github.com/zhs007/tradingcore).
